- 👋 Hi, I’m @carriegraham-dev
- 👀 I’m interested in music, art, interwebs
- 🌱 I’m currently learning front-end webdev at BCIT - so far I'm a generalist, we'll see what I get good at.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on spinny widgets for web interfaces, cool navs, page effects, etc, I'm pretty new, so I'm learning simple things for now: CSS/HTML, Vanilla JS / Bootstrap / JQuery, PHP, React mostly.
- 📫 How to reach me: carrie@carriegraham.dev
